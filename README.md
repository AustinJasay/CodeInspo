# CodeInspo

## This app was created for the "Dynamic with React" course from Nucamp. It is still being worked on.

### CodeInspo is a web app built with React, Bootstrap, and Redux. It was designed for developers who are struggling to come up with ideas for their next project. Simply click the refresh button until you find a project that inspires you, then start coding, or click the heart button to add it to your favorites to come back to it later.

###### Current project ideas are just filler, that will be filled in and replaced with real ideas soon. There will also be a future update that allows users to create accounts, save their favorites to their account, and vote on and submit project ideas.
